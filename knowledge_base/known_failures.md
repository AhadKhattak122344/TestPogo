# Known Failures - Do Not Retry Without New Evidence

Last updated: 2026-09-14

## Pokemon GO API 34 With ARM64 Translation

Status: failed.

Symptoms: `Fatal signal 4 (SIGILL)` in `UnityMain` after `ndk_translation`
initializes.

Evidence: `experiments/EXPERIMENT_LOG.md` entries H04 and F01.

Do not retry as a login or root-hiding fix. The observed failure is native
translation, and Magisk root did not resolve it.

Alternative: keep launch investigations on the clean API 36 baseline unless a new
device/runtime supplies different evidence.

## Clean API 36 Login Repeats

Status: failed for playable login with the designated account.

Symptoms: Pokemon GO reaches account/sign-in flow, then shows Failed to Sign In;
crash buffer remains empty.

Evidence: F02, F03/C01, L10-L17.

Do not repeat warm foregrounding, data-preserving cold restart, or selecting the
same account again without a changed variable. The next useful comparison is a
certified physical Android or publisher-side transaction diagnosis.

## API 36.1 Google Play Runtime Display

Status: failed display stability.

Symptoms: boot markers can pass, but SurfaceFlinger aborts with the same
GoldfishMapper readFromHost assertion and screenshot capture fails.

Evidence: L19-L21.

Do not treat boot completion as usable display readiness for this profile.

## API 37 Auto/Host Rendering First Boot

Status: failed initial boot.

Symptoms: ADB remained offline through the bounded startup window.

Evidence: L22.

Follow-up L23/L24 software tests and F02 swangle tests also failed display
validation. New renderer/image/runtime evidence is required before another attempt.

## API37 swangle with DMA/Vulkan controls disabled

F02 reached boot completion but failed PNG display capture. The host accepted
GLDMA, GLDMA2, Vulkan and VulkanNativeSwapchain disable flags and selected
SwiftShader. The guest still hit the same mapper.ranchu.so
hasReadColorBufferDma assertion and BuildId as L23/L24. Astra/medium compared
the saved evidence on September15 and found no distinct corrective flag justified
by those logs. The case stays in fleet-matrix.json with enabled=false.

Evidence: artifacts/fleet-start-20260914-230256/fleet_api37_angle and
artifacts/fleet-sweep-20260914-225823/summary.json. A new physical/runtime setup
remains untested; this is not a universal incompatibility claim.

## Docker/WSL Android Without KVM

Status: reported unsuccessful.

Evidence: H02 and `docs/DEBUGGING.md`.

Do not repeat this host's software-emulated Docker path unless new evidence shows
usable `/dev/kvm` or equivalent acceleration.

## Archived Identity, Concealment, and Integrity Scripts

Status: rejected for active compatibility fixes.

Evidence: `docs/DEBUGGING.md`.

Do not execute archived identity/concealment/integrity scripts or treat string
changes as certification evidence.

## Pasted Play Integrity Bypass And Anti-Detection Runbook

Status: rejected.

Evidence: latest pasted implementation request and `codex_memory/attempted_approaches.json`
entry P02.

Do not implement or operationalize root-concealment modules, Play Integrity
bypass checks, device identity spoofing, ADB hiding, mock-location hiding,
behavioral anti-detection, or residential proxy masking for Pokemon GO.

Alternative: keep work to legitimate device-farm lifecycle automation, evidence
capture, official compatibility testing, a certified physical Android comparison,
or publisher-side diagnosis.
